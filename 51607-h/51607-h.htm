<p class='c000'>In Grecian mythology it is related that Zeus, warned by an oracle that
the son of his spouse, Metis, would snatch supremacy from him, swallowed
both Metis and her unborn child. When the time of birth arrived, Zeus
felt a violent pain in his head, and in his agony requested Hephæstus to
cleave the head open with an ax. His request was complied with, and
from the brain of the great god sprang Athena, full-armed, and with a
mighty war-shout. She at once assumed a high place among the divinities
of Olympus. She first took part in the discussions of the gods as
an opponent of the savage Ares. She gave counsel to her father against
the giants; and she slew Enceládus, the most powerful of those who conspired
against Zeus, and buried him under Mt. Ætna. She became the
patron of heroism among men, and her active and original genius inspired
their employment. The agriculturist and the mechanic were under her
special protection, and the philosopher, the poet and the orator delighted
in her favor. The ægis was in her helmet, and she represented the
ether—pure air. She was worshipped at Athens because she caused the
olive to grow on the bare rock of the Acropolis. She was also the protectress
of the arts of peace among women. She bore in her hand the
spool, the spindle, and the needle, and she invented and excelled in all
the work of women. She was the goddess of wisdom and the symbol of
thought; she represented military skill and civic prudence. In war she
was heroic and invincible; in peace she was wise, strong, inventive, and
industrious.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE ATHENA OF AMERICAN STATES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Kansas is the Athena of American States. Thirty-six years ago the
Slave Oligarchy ruled this country. Fearing that the birth of new States
in the West would rob it of supremacy, the Slave Power swallowed the
Missouri Compromise, which had dedicated the Northwest to Freedom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The industrious North, aroused and indignant, struck quick and hard,
and Kansas, full-armed, shouting the war-cry of Liberty, and nerved
with invincible courage, sprang into the Union. She at once assumed a
high place among the States. She was the deadly enemy of Slavery; she
gave voice and potency to the demand for its abolition; and she aided in
burying Secession in its unhonored grave. The war over, she became the
patron, as she had been during its continuance the exemplar, of heroism,
and a hundred thousand soldiers of the Union found homes within the
shelter of her embracing arms. The agriculturist and the mechanic were
charmed by her ample resources and inspired by her eager enterprise.
Education found in her a generous patron, and to literature, art and
science she has been a steadfast friend. Her pure atmosphere invigorated
all. A desert disfigured the map of the Continent, and she covered it
with fields of golden wheat and tasseling corn. She has extended to
women the protection of generous laws and of enlarged opportunities for
usefulness. In war she was valiant and indomitable, and in peace she
has been intelligent, energetic, progressive and enterprising. The modern
Athena, type of the great Greek goddess, is our Kansas.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE CHILD OF A GREAT ERA.</h3>

<p class='c007'>It is not a long lapse of time since the 29th of January, 1861. A boy
born during that eventful year cast his first Presidential vote at the last
election. But no other period of the world's history has been so fertile in
invention, so potential in thought, so restless and aggressive in energy, or
so crowded with sublime achievements, as the quarter-century succeeding
the admission of Kansas as a State. During that period occurred the
greatest war the world has ever known. An industrious, self-governed,
peace-loving people, transfigured by the inspiration of patriotism and
freedom, became, within a twelve-month, a Nation of trained and disciplined
warriors. Human slavery, entrenched for centuries in law,
tradition, wealth, and the pride of race, was annihilated, and five million
slaves were clothed with the powers and responsibilities of citizenship.
The continent was girdled with railroad and telegraph lines. In
1860 there were only 31,186 miles of railway in the United States; there
are now fully 130,000 miles. Less than 50,000 miles of telegraph wires
were stretched at the date of the admission of Kansas; there are now
nearly 300,000 miles. The telephone and the electric light are fruits of
this period, and the improvements and inventions in farm implements, in
books and newspapers, in all the appliances of mechanical industry, and
in the arts and sciences, have revolutionized nearly every department of
human activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this marvelous era dawned upon the world, Kansas was a fiction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>of the geographers. On the map of our country it was marked as
a desert, and the few explorers who had penetrated its vast solitudes
described it as an arid and sandy waste, fit only for the wild bison or the
wilder Indian. There it had lain for centuries, voiceless and changeless,
waiting for the miracle of civilization to touch and transform it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska bill made Kansas the central figure
in a tremendous conflict. It became not only the child of a marvelous
epoch, and heir to all the progress, the achievements and the glory
of that epoch, but it stood for an idea; it represented a principle; and
that idea and principle thrilled the heart and awakened the conscience of
the Nation. That a State cradled amid such events, schooled during such
a period, and inspired by such sentiments, should, in its growth and development,
illustrate these mighty energies and impulses, was inevitable.
The Kansas of to-day is only the logical sequence of the influences and
agencies that have surrounded, shaped and directed every step and stage
of the States material and administrative progress.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>NOT THE HISTORIAN.</h3>

<p class='c007'>I am not, however, the historian of this occasion. Very properly the
committee assigned to my honored predecessor, the first Governor of the
State—who has been with and of it during all the lights and shadows
of thirty-one revolving years—the duty of presenting an historical sketch
of the difficulties and dangers through which Kansas was "added to the
stars," and became one of the brightest in the constellation of the Union.
To me was allotted another task—that of presenting, as briefly and as
clearly as I am able, the material development of Kansas, and her present
condition and position. It is at once a delightful and a difficult task.
The growth of Kansas is a theme which has always enlisted my interest
and excited my pride. But I cannot hope to present any adequate picture
of the Kansas you know so well—the Kansas of your love and of your
faith; the imperial young State, at once the enigma and the wonder of
American commonwealths.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THREE PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The development of Kansas, it seems to me, has had three periods,
which may properly be called the decades of War, of Uncertainty, and
of Triumph. From 1855 to 1865, Kansas was an armed camp. The
border troubles, outbreaking late in 1854, continued until the rebellion
was inaugurated. Kansas, in fact, began the war six years before the
Nation had fired a shot, and the call to arms in 1861 found here a singularly
martial people, who responded with unparalleled enthusiasm to the
President's demands for men. In less than a year ten full regiments were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>organized, and before the close of the war Kansas had sent over twenty
thousand soldiers to the field, out of a population of but little more than a
hundred thousand. Fields, workshops, offices and schools were deserted,
and the patient and heroic women who had kept weary vigils during all
the dark and desolate days of the border troubles, now waited in their
lonely home for tidings from the larger field of the civil war.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is doubtful whether Kansas increased, either in population or wealth,
from 1861 to 1864. But the young State grew in public interest and
reputation, and when the heroic men, whose valor and patriotism had
saved the Republic, began to be mustered out, Kansas offered an inviting
field for their energy, and they came hither in great numbers. The population
of the State, which was 107,206 in 1860, had increased to 140,179
in 1865. The assessed value of its property increased from $22,518,232
to $36,110,000 during the same period, and the land in farms from
1,778,400 to 3,500,000 acres. It was not a "boom," nor was it stagnation
and decay. Yet it is probable that nearly the whole of the growth
shown by these figures dates from the Spring of 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>The real development of Kansas began in 1865, and it has known few
interruptions since. The census of 1870 showed a population of 364,399—an
increase of 124,220 in five years, or nearly double the population
of 1865. Railroad building also began in 1865, and 1,283 miles were
completed by 1870. The home-returning soldiers and the railroads came
together. Immigrants to other States came in slow-moving canal boats
or canvas-covered wagons, but they came to Kansas in the lightning
express, and most of them went to their claims in comfortable cars drawn
by that marvel of modern mechanism, the locomotive. Our State has
never had a "coon-skin cap" population. It is the child of the prairies,
not of the forest. It has always attracted men of intelligence, who knew
a good thing when they saw it. They brought with them the school,
the church and the printing press; they planted an orchard and a grove
as soon as they had harvested their first crop; and if they were compelled
to live in a dug-out the first year or two, they were reasonably certain to
own a comfortable house the third.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE PERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The period from 1865 to 1875 was, however, a period of uncertainty.
Kansas remained an experiment. The drouth and grasshopper invasion
of 1860, a menacing memory for many years, had just begun to grow
dim when the drouth of 1873 and the still more disastrous drouth and
locust invasion of 1874 revived its recollection, and intensified the uncertainty
it had inspired. The intervening years were not, it is true, without
their exaltation and triumphs. Luxuriant harvests followed the disaster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of 1860, year after year in unbroken succession, until 1873, and
we indulged in much jubilant boasting and self-gratulation over our
fruitful soil, our benign climate, and our gracious seasons. But over and
through it all brooded and ran a feeling of question or uncertainty,
which manifested itself in many ways. The newspapers, while affecting
to sneer at those who did not believe Kansas to be a country where rains
always came just when they were wanted, nevertheless recorded every
rain with suspicious prominence. Even the corner-lot speculator watched
the clouds while he was denouncing the slanderers who asserted that
Kansas was "a dry country." "Methinks the lady doth protest too
much," might have been said of the Kansans who, from 1865 to 1875,
vehemently maintained that the normal condition of Kansas was that of
a quagmire.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in the midst of it all came 1873 and 1874, with their twin devastations
and calamities. A fierce sun rose and set for months in a cloudless
sky; the parched earth shrank and cracked; and the crops withered
and shriveled in winds as hot as the breath of a furnace. But as if the
destruction thus wrought was not enough, out from the northwest came
clouds of insects, darkening the sun in their baleful flight, and leaving
the very abomination of desolation wherever they alighted. It was then
that the bravest quailed, and our sturdiest farmers abandoned all hope.
Thousands of people, now among our most prosperous citizens, would
have sold everything they possessed for one-sixth of its value, during the
year 1874, and abandoned the State forever. But they could find no purchasers,
even at such a price.</p>

<p class='c000'>Somehow—and I mention the fact to their everlasting credit—many
of the newspapers of Kansas never lost heart or hope during that distressful
season. They lauded the State more earnestly, if possible, than
ever before. They asserted, with vehement iteration, that the season was
exceptional and phenomenal. They exhorted the people to keep up
courage, and confidently predicted abundant harvests next year. And to
their influence more than any other, is due the fact that Kansas survived
the drouth and grasshopper invasion of 1874 with so little loss of population.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE PERIOD OF TRIUMPH.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The period of triumph began in 1875. While the world was still
talking of our State as a drouth-powdered and insect-eaten country, Kansas
was preparing for the Centennial, and getting ready for a great future.
And in 1876, she sprang into the arena of Nations with a display
of her products and resources which eclipsed them all, and excited the
wonder and admiration of the whole civilized earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>From that time to this the development of Kansas has never known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>a halt, nor have the hopes of our citizens ever been troubled by a doubt.
More permanent and costly homes have been builded, more stately public
edifices have been reared, more substantial improvements have been made
on farms and in towns, more wealth has been accumulated, during the
decade beginning in 1875, than during the two previous decades. No
citizen of Kansas, from that day to this, has ever written a letter, made
a speech, or talked at home or abroad, with his fellow-citizens or with
strangers, without exalting the resources and glorifying the greatness of
the State. No Legislature, since that time, has ever doubted the ability
of the State to do anything it pleased to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>A new Kansas has been developed during that period. The youth of
1875 has grown to the full stature and strength of confident and intelligent
manhood. The people have forgotten to talk of drouths, which are
no more incident to Kansas than to Ohio or Illinois. They no longer
watch the clouds when rain has not fallen for two weeks. The newspapers
no longer chronicle rains as if they were uncommon visitations. A
great many things, besides the saloons, have gone, and gone to stay. The
bone-hunter and the buffalo-hunter of the plains, the Indian and his
reservations, the jayhawker and the Wild Bills, the Texas steer and the
cowboy, the buffalo grass and the dug-outs, the loneliness and immensity
of the unpeopled prairies, the infinite stretching of the plains, unbroken
by tree or shrub, by fence or house—all these have vanished, or are
rapidly vanishing. In their stead has come, and come to stay, an aggressive,
energetic, cultured, sober, law-respecting civilization. Labor-saving
machines sweep majestically through fields of golden wheat or sprouting
corn; blooded stock lazily feed in meadows of blue-stem, timothy, or
clover; comfortable houses dot every hill-top and valley; forests, orchards
and hedge-rows diversify the loveliness of the landscape; and where isolation
and wildness brooded, the majestic lyric of prosperous industry is
echoing over eighty-one thousand square miles of the loveliest and most
fertile country that the sun, in his daily journey, lights and warms. The
voiceless Sphynx of thirty years ago has become the whispering-gallery
of the continent. The oppressed Territory of 1855, the beggared State
of 1874, has become a Prince, ruling the markets of the world with opulent
harvests.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE FACTS OF THE CENSUS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>I am not, in thus exalting the growth and prosperity of Kansas, speaking
recklessly, as I shall show by statistics compiled from the census and
agricultural reports of the United States and our own State. Figures are
always dry, I know. But when they tell the pleasant story of the march
of civilization into and over a new land, surely they cannot fail to interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>men and women who have themselves marched with this conquering army
of industry and peace.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE GROWTH OF KANSAS WITHOUT PARALLEL.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The growth of Kansas has had no parallel. The great States of New
York and Pennsylvania were nearly a hundred and fifty years in attaining
a population Kansas has reached in thirty years. Kentucky was eighty
years, Tennessee seventy-five, Alabama ninety, Ohio forty-five, and Massachusetts,
New Jersey, Georgia, and North and South Carolina each over a
hundred years, in reaching the present population of Kansas. Even the
marvelous growth of the great States of the West has been surpassed by
that of Kansas. Illinois was organized as a Territory in 1810, and thirty
years later had only 691,392 inhabitants, or not much more than one-half
the present population of this State. Indiana was organized in 1800, and
sixty years later had a population of only 1,350,428. Iowa was organized
as a Territory in 1838, and had, at that date, a population of nearly 40,000.
In 1870 it had only 1,194,020 inhabitants. Missouri was organized in 1812,
with a population of over 40,000, and fifty years later had only 1,182,012.
Michigan and Wisconsin, after fifty years of growth, did not have as many
people as Kansas has to-day; and Texas, admitted into the Union in 1845,
with a population of 150,000, had, thirty-five years later, only 815,579
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1861 Kansas ranked in population as the thirty-third State of the
Union; in 1870 it was the twenty-ninth; in 1880 the twentieth; and it
is now the fifteenth. During the past quarter of a century Kansas has
outstripped Oregon, Rhode Island, Delaware, Florida, Arkansas, Vermont,
New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maine, Minnesota, Maryland, Mississippi,
California, North and South Carolina, Alabama, Wisconsin, and New
Jersey—all States before the 29th of January, 1861. Of the Northern
States only eight, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, and Iowa, and of the Southern States only six, Georgia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Virginia, and Texas, now outrank
Kansas in population. At the close of the present decade Kansas will,
I am confident, rank as the eleventh State of the American Union, and
will round out the Nineteenth Century as the sixth or seventh.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>TOWNS AND CITIES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>In 1860 there were only ten towns and cities in Kansas having a population
in excess of 500 each; only three having over 1,000 each; and
only one having over 5,000 inhabitants. In 1880, ninety-nine towns
each had a population in excess of 500; fifty-five towns and cities had
each over 1,000 inhabitants; six had each over 5,000; and three had
over 15,000 each. In 1885, each of one hundred and fifty-four towns had
over 500 population; ninety-one towns and cities had each over 1,000;
twelve had each over 5,000; six had each over 10,000; four had each
over 15,000; and two had each more than 20,000.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE POPULATION.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The origin and character of the population in Kansas is, in this connection,
worthy of special note. Every State in the Union and every
Territory except Alaska, contributed to the population of this State. The
United States census of 1880 shows that 233,066 persons born in Kansas
were then living in the State. The singular fact that native-born Kansans
were then living in every State and Territory, is shown by the same
authority. Illinois contributed 106,992 to our population; Ohio, 93,396;
Indiana, 77,096; Missouri, 60,228; Pennsylvania, 59,236; Iowa, 55,972;
New York, 43,779; and Kentucky, 32,979. Three other States, Tennessee,
Virginia, and Wisconsin, each contributed over 15,000; and all
others less than that number.</p>

<p class='c000'>The same authority shows that the so-called "exodus" from the South
has been greatly exaggerated, Louisiana and Mississippi furnishing only
4,067 of our colored population, while nearly 19,000 came from the three
States of Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee.</p>

<p class='c000'>The colored people constitute, at the present time, less than four per
cent. of our total population, and the inhabitants of foreign birth a little
more than ten per cent. of the total.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h3 class='c006'>THE MATERIAL RESOURCES OF KANSAS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The growth of our State in population has not, however, equalled the
development of its material resources. The United States census of 1880
shows that while Kansas, at that date, ranked as the twentieth State in
population, it was the eighth State in the number and value of its live
stock, the seventeenth in farm products, the fourteenth in value of farm
products per capita, the twentieth in wealth, the thirteenth in education,
the seventeenth in the amount of its indebtedness, State and municipal,
and the twenty-fourth in manufactures. Only one State, Nebraska,
shows a smaller proportion of persons unable to read and write. And
in twenty-eight of the forty-seven States and Territories, taxation, per
capita, was greater than it is in Kansas.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1880 Kansas was the sixth corn-producing State of the Union.
Only Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, and Ohio then produced larger
crops of this cereal. But the corn product of Kansas, that year, was
only 101,421,718 bushels, while for the year 1885 it was 194,130,814
bushels, or nearly double the crop of 1880.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>In the following table the aggregate of the corn, wheat, oats, potato,
and hay products of Kansas, for the years 1860 and 1865, and for each
year thereafter, is given. The figures, prior to 1875, are compiled from
the reports of the United States Department of Agriculture; those following,
from the reports of the secretary of our own State Board of
Agriculture:</p>

<p class='c000'>In presenting these figures it is worthy of note that while, as already
stated, the U. S. census reports for 1880 show that Kansas ranked as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>twentieth State in population and the sixth in its corn product, it was also
the eleventh wheat-producing State of the Union, the eleventh in its oats
product, sixteenth in barley, tenth in rye, eighth in hay, and seventeenth
in potatoes. Thus the rank of Kansas, in agricultural products, was far
ahead of her rank in population.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE AREA OF KANSAS.</h3>

<h3 class='c006'>THE WEALTH OF AN AGRICULTURAL STATE.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Kansas is an agricultural State. It has no gold or silver, no iron, and
just coal enough to furnish fuel. It is the farmers' and stockmen's State.
Its development simply shows what good old Mother Earth, when in her
happiest vein, can do. "Agriculture," says Colton, "is the most certain
source of strength, wealth, and independence; commerce, in all emergencies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>looks to agriculture both for defense and for supply." The growth
and prosperity of Kansas afford a striking illustration of what intelligent
farmers, with a productive soil and a genial climate for their workshop,
can accomplish—what wealth they can create, what enterprise they can
stimulate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is difficult, however, to comprehend what the figures I have given,
showing the amounts and values of Kansas products, really represent.
When we read that Kansas produced, last year, 194,130,000 bushels of
corn, the nine figures set down do not convey any adequate idea of the
bulk and weight of this crop. But when it is stated that the corn crop
of Kansas for 1885 would fill 485,000 freight cars, and load a train
2,847 miles long—reaching from Ogden, Utah, to Boston—we begin to
comprehend what the figures stand for.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wheat crop of the State, last year, was called a failure. It was,
for Kansas. And yet it would fill 31,939 grain cars, and load a train
189 miles in length. The oats crop of the State, for the same year,
would fill 44,335 cars, and load a train 260 miles long; while the hay
crop would load 768,534 cars, making a train 4,510 miles long.</p>

<p class='c000'>These four crops of Kansas, for 1885, would fill 1,329,808 grain cars,
and load a train 7,804 miles in length. In other words, the corn, wheat,
oats, and hay produced in Kansas last year would load a train reaching
from Boston to San Francisco by the Union Pacific route, and back again
from San Francisco to Boston by the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé route.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>COMPARATIVE VALUES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>In speaking of the value of the farm crops and farm products of Kansas,
I can present a dearer idea of the wealth our farmers have digged
out of the earth by some comparisons. In 1881 the products of all the
gold and silver mines of the United States aggregated only $77,700,000;
for 1882 they aggregated $79,300,000; for 1883, $76,200,000; and for
1884, $79,600,000—making a total, for those four years, of $312,800,000.
The value of the field crops of Kansas, for the same years, aggregated
$411,092,498; and the farm products of the State for the same period,
aggregated in value $595,099,894—or very nearly double the aggregate
of all the gold and silver products of all the mines of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gold and silver products of the world average about $208,000,000
per annum. The farm products of Kansas for 1885 aggregated
$143,577,018, or nearly three-fourths the value of the gold and silver
product of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the past four years the farm products of Kansas have aggregated
in value each year more than double the annual yield of all the gold and
silver mines of the United States.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>The gold and silver products of Colorado, for 1883, aggregated only
$20,250,000; those of California, $16,600,000; of Nevada, $9,100,000;
of Montana, $9,170,000; of Utah, $6,920,000; of Arizona, $5,430,000;
and of New Mexico, $3,300,000. The corn crop of Kansas for the same
year was alone worth more money than the combined gold and silver
products of Colorado, California and Nevada; the oat crop of Kansas
was worth $705,000 more than the gold and silver product of Arizona;
and the Irish potato crop of Kansas was worth more than the gold and
silver product of New Mexico.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>PROPERTY VALUATIONS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The property valuations of Kansas have increased in steady proportion
with the growth of the State in population and productions. In 1860
the true valuation of all the property of the State was estimated at $31,327,891;
in 1865 it was estimated at $72,252,180; in 1870 it had
increased to $188,892,014; in 1875 to $242,555,862; in 1880 to $321,783,387;
and for 1885 the true valuation, at a very moderate estimate,
was $550,000,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following table presents the assessed valuation of all the property
of the State for the years mentioned, and also the assessed valuation of
all the real, personal, and railroad property. It will be seen that the increase
in the total assessed values from 1865 to 1875 was $85,434,344,
while from 1875 to 1885 it was $127,300,928.</p>

the plow. It has, however, coal deposits equal to the needs of its population,
valuable lead mines in the southeast, and salt and gypsum in
abundance. But the manufacturing establishments of the State are steadily
increasing in importance as well as in number. In its flouring and
grist mills Kansas ranked, in 1880, as the thirteenth State of the Union;
in meat packing, as the twelfth; and in cheese products, as the fourteenth.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.</h3>

<p class='c007'>The transportation facilities of Kansas are unsurpassed. Only seven
States of the Union, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa and Missouri, have within their borders more miles of completed
railway than has Kansas. For fully two hundred miles west of our
eastern border, every county except one is traversed by from one to six
lines of railway. There are eighty-six organized and eleven unorganized
counties in the State, and of these all except fourteen organized and seven
unorganized counties have railways within their limits. In 1864 Kansas
had not a mile of completed railroad. In 1870 we had 1,283 miles;
in 1875 over 1,887 miles; in 1880 an aggregate of 3,104 miles, and
there are now 4,750 miles of completed railway in Kansas.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>THE SCHOOLS OF KANSAS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Education has gone hand in hand with the material growth of Kansas.
It has been the boast of our people, for twenty years past, that the best
building in every city, town or hamlet in the State was the school house.
The census of 1880 revealed the fact that only 25,503 inhabitants of
Kansas, over ten years of age, were unable to read. The growth of our
school system is shown by the following figures:</p>

only $1,700, while the expenditures for the same purpose, during the
year 1885, aggregated $2,977,763. For the five years ending with 1865,
the expenditures for public schools aggregated $262,657.21; for the next
succeeding five years they aggregated $2,259,497.89; for the next five,
$7,552,191.43; for the next five, $7,509,375.23; and for the five years

<h3 class='c006'>CHURCHES AND NEWSPAPERS.</h3>

<p class='c007'>Churches have multiplied and newspapers increased as have the schools.
In 1860 there were only 97 church buildings in Kansas, and they had
cost only $143,950. In 1870 the number of churches had increased to
301, valued at $1,722,700; and in 1880 they numbered 2,514, costing an
aggregate of $2,491,560.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were only 27 newspapers published in Kansas in 1860, and of
these only three were dailies. In 1870 the number had increased to 97,
of which 12 were dailies. In 1880 there were 347 newspapers, including
20 dailies. During the year just closed 581 journals, of which 32 were
dailies, were published in Kansas. The aggregate circulation of our
newspapers, in 1860, was 21,920, while for 1885 their circulation aggregated
395,400. Every organized county has one or more newspapers,
and, as a rule, our journals are creditable to their publishers and to the
State.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>WHAT OF THE FUTURE?</h3>

<p class='c007'>And now, having sketched the growth of Kansas during the past quarter
of a century, it is proper to ask, what of the future? I answer, with
confidence, that Kansas is yet in the dawn of her development, and that
the growth, prosperity and triumphs of the next decade will surpass any
we have yet known. Less than one-fifth of the area of the State has been
broken by the plow—ten million of fifty-two million acres. Multiply
the present development by five, and you can perhaps form some idea of
the Kansas of the year 1900. The light of the morning is still shining
upon our prairie slopes. The year just closed witnessed the first actual,
permanent settlements in the counties along our Western frontier—not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>settlement by wandering stockmen or occasional frontiersmen, but by
practical, home-building farmers and business men. The line of organized
counties now extends four hundred miles, from the Missouri river
to the Colorado line. The scientists, I know, are still discussing climatic
changes, and questioning whether the western third of Kansas is fit for
general farming. But the homesteader in Cheyenne or Hamilton counties
entertains no doubt about this question. He has no weather-gauge
or barometer, but he sees the buffalo grass vanishing and the blue-joint
sending its long roots deep into the soil; he sees the trees growing on the
high divides; he watches the corn he has planted springing up, and waving
its green guidons of prosperity in the wind; he sees the clouds gathering
and drifting, and he hears the rain pattering on his roof—and he
knows all he cares to know about climatic changes. He is going to stay.</p>

<h3 class='c006'>A PROPHECY FULFILLED.</h3>

<p class='c007'>On the 7th of May, 1856, a great American, learned, sagacious, and
confident in his faith that right and justice would at last prevail, said,
in a speech delivered in the City of New York:</p>

<p class='c013'>"In the year of our Lord 1900, there will be two million people in Kansas,
with cities like Providence and Worcester—perhaps like Chicago
and Cincinnati. She will have more miles of railroad than Maryland,
Virginia, and both the Carolinas can now boast. Her land will be worth
twenty dollars an acre, and her total wealth will be five hundred millions
of money. Six hundred thousand children will learn in her schools.
What schools, newspapers, libraries, meeting-houses! Yes, what families
of educated, happy and religious men and women! There will be a
song of Freedom all around the Slave States, and in them Slavery itself
will die."</p>

<p class='c000'>Read in the light of the present, these eloquent words of Theodore
Parker seem touched with prophetic fire. The ideal Kansas he saw,
looking through the mists of the future, is the real Kansas of to-day.
The marvelous growth, the splendid prosperity, the potent intellectual
and moral energies, and the happy and contented life he predicted, are
all around us. At the threshold of the year A. D. 1886, fifteen years
before the limit of his prophecy, Kansas has cities like Providence and
Worcester; has more than double the railway mileage Maryland, Virginia,
and both the Carolinas could then boast; has land worth, not twenty,
but fifty and a hundred dollars an acre; has wealth far exceeding five
hundred million dollars; has schools, newspapers, libraries and churches
rivaling those of New England; and has 1,300,000 happy, prosperous
and intelligent people.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prophecy has been fulfilled, but the end is not yet. The foundations
of the State, like those of its Capitol, have just been completed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The stately building, crowned with its splendid dome, is yet to be reared.
Smiling and opulent fields, busy and prosperous cities and towns, are still
attracting the intelligent, the enterprising and the ambitious of every
State and country. The limits that bound the progress and development
of Kansas cannot now be gauged or guessed. We have land, homes,
work and plenty for millions more; and for another quarter of a century,
at least, our State will continue to grow. For we are yet at the
threshold and in the dawn of it all. We are just beginning to realize
what a great people can accomplish, whom "love of country moveth, example
teacheth, company comforteth, emulation quickeneth, and glory
exalteth."</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
